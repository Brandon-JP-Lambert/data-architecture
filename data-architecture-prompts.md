## Prompts 1-3:

**Prompt 1:**

```
Write Mermaid syntax for an ER diagram for [database].
```
Replace `[database]` with the desired platform or project for which you want to create an ER diagram.

**Prompt 2:**

```
Improve this as a [role].
```
Replace `[role]` with your expertise, such as "senior data scientist" or "database architect", to refine and optimize the initial database design.

**Prompt 3:**
```
Write a Python program that generates [number] [entities] and dummy data based on the ER diagram. Use the OpenAI API to build prompts into the code that creates random but contextually appropriate content. Write the script to ensure that prompts don't produce very similar results.
```
Replace `[number]` with the desired number of entities and `[entities]` with the type of entities (e.g., learners, users, products) for which you want to generate dummy data.
